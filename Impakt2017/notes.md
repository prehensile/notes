###Â Session: Speculative Realities

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN_j0pvi6RE

#### Scott Smith ðŸŒŸ

- the increasing difficulty of knowing what's real and what's fake
- cross-quadrant workign group
- [Jim Dator's Four Futures](http://www.foresightguide.com/dator-four-futures/) - different types of possible futures
    1. Growth (business as usual, more of the status quo growth)
    2. Collapse (system degradation or failure modes as crisis emerges)
    3. Discipline (behaviors to adapt to growing internal or environmental limits)
    4. Transformation (new technology, business, or social factors that change the game)
- we're now in a state of "narrative collapse"
- power (e.g governments) very good at projecting a whole image of a future e.g Trumpism
- the idea of projecting realities as a defense mechanism against an increasingly awful present
-- points to the success of e.g immersive experiences, fandoms. 'alternate timelines' being watercooler chat
- suggests a 5th kind of future: dissent
- putting future worldbuilding tools into the hands of activists
- dissent is counter-worldbuilding

#### Edwin Gardner

- the three-fold model of imagination / money
- "most capital is invested in the status quo"
- "money is an unreliable mistress"
- "money needs a yes" - money needs a plan to follow, not a thing to stop
- "fact follows fiction"

#### Michelle Kasprzak

- "socialtechnical imaginaries" (Jasanoff)
- High Modernism vs metis (Scott)
- Rigo 23

#### Navine G. Khan-Dossos ðŸŒŸ

https://youtu.be/QPGcJkHqpxc?t=18m37s

Discussing her work "Expanding & Remaining", where she took the Islamic State propaganda magazine Dabiq and made a series of paintings abstracting its graphic design - reproducing the shapes of the layouts without reproducingthe content. She's interested in how this magazine came to be - who made it? Where? How? They used a Mac - did they also have a newsroom? Mood boards?

#### Maranke Wieringa & Daniela Geenen

- used in decision-making

Datavis is not neutral!

###Â Session: Smart Objects

#### Opening remarks: Betti Marenko ðŸŒŸ

https://youtu.be/1L2KcGUcnjE?t=7m44s
- "the strange animism of connected objects"
- "clearly we are under a collective digital spell. smart objects enchant us, they keep us hypnotised as they harvest attention time and live information from us. some would even say that they are the product of sociopathic design."

#### Joel Vacheron ðŸŒŸ

https://youtu.be/1L2KcGUcnjE?t=13m1s

#### Luis Fernando Medina Cardona

https://youtu.be/1L2KcGUcnjE?t=32m51s

- Layers of abstraction in software & networks
-- OS, low level langauges,  high level langauges
-- OSI seven-layer model
- TCP/IP - not elegant, but better than the layered, bureaucratic alternative
- stacks are a myth. everything takes shortcuts
- internet is not an anarchist utopia. the infrastrcture generally llives in traditional centres of power.

#### Peter Moosgaard ðŸŒŸ
- IoT == animism, a desire to return to connection with objects
- cargoclub.tumblr.com
- "engaging with the global sublime"
- "everyone is confused all the time"
- cargo cults created ritualistic versions of e.g landing strips to summon planes from the skies
--- and it worked! summoned planes full of anthropologists & tourists
- did a project rebuilding Gehry, Bauhaus in the Phillipines
