## Thursday

###Â Session: Speculative Realities

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN_j0pvi6RE

#### Scott Smith ðŸŒŸ

- the increasing difficulty of knowing what's real and what's fake
- cross-quadrant workign group
- [Jim Dator's Four Futures](http://www.foresightguide.com/dator-four-futures/) - different types of possible futures
    1. Growth (business as usual, more of the status quo growth)
    2. Collapse (system degradation or failure modes as crisis emerges)
    3. Discipline (behaviors to adapt to growing internal or environmental limits)
    4. Transformation (new technology, business, or social factors that change the game)
- we're now in a state of "narrative collapse"
- power (e.g governments) very good at projecting a whole image of a future e.g Trumpism
- the idea of projecting realities as a defense mechanism against an increasingly awful present
-- points to the success of e.g immersive experiences, fandoms. 'alternate timelines' being watercooler chat
- suggests a 5th kind of future: dissent
- putting future worldbuilding tools into the hands of activists
- dissent is counter-worldbuilding

#### Edwin Gardner

- the three-fold model of imagination / money
- "most capital is invested in the status quo"
- "money is an unreliable mistress"
- "money needs a yes" - money needs a plan to follow, not a thing to stop
- "fact follows fiction"

#### Michelle Kasprzak

- "socialtechnical imaginaries" (Jasanoff)
- High Modernism vs metis (Scott)
- Rigo 23

#### Navine G. Khan-Dossos ðŸŒŸ

https://youtu.be/QPGcJkHqpxc?t=18m37s

Discussing her work "Expanding & Remaining", where she took the Islamic State propaganda magazine Dabiq and made a series of paintings abstracting its graphic design - reproducing the shapes of the layouts without reproducingthe content. She's interested in how this magazine came to be - who made it? Where? How? They used a Mac - did they also have a newsroom? Mood boards?

#### Maranke Wieringa & Daniela Geenen

Datavis as interface
- mediates between user and data
- used in decision-making

Datavis is not neutral!

#### Opening remarks: Betti Marenko ðŸŒŸ

https://youtu.be/1L2KcGUcnjE?t=7m44s
- "the strange animism of connected objects"
- "clearly we are under a collective digital spell. smart objects enchant us, they keep us hypnotised as they harvest attention time and live information from us. some would even say that they are the product of sociopathic design."

#### Joel Vacheron ðŸŒŸ

https://youtu.be/1L2KcGUcnjE?t=13m1s

Bits of technology which come along and make new art possible

Bunch of stuff about [David Em](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Em)'s residency at JPL

#### Luis Fernando Medina Cardona

https://youtu.be/1L2KcGUcnjE?t=32m51s

- Layers of abstraction in software & networks
-- OS, low level langauges,  high level langauges
-- OSI seven-layer model
- TCP/IP - not elegant, but better than the layered, bureaucratic alternative (OSI)
- stacks are a myth. everything takes shortcuts
- internet is not an anarchist utopia. the infrastrcture generally llives in traditional centres of power.

#### Peter Moosgaard ðŸŒŸ
- IoT == animism, a desire to return to connection with objects
- cargoclub.tumblr.com
- "engaging with the global sublime"
- "everyone is confused all the time"
- cargo cults created ritualistic versions of e.g landing strips to summon planes from the skies
--- and it worked! summoned planes full of anthropologists & tourists
- did a project rebuilding Gehry, Bauhaus in the Phillipines

- "without us, there is no data"

- "every time we visualise data, we add to the cultural idea of what data is and what it does"

#### Lydia Nicholas ðŸŒŸ

https://youtu.be/11hX-ptQZbw?t=23m11s

#### Julian Oliver ðŸŒŸ

https://youtu.be/11hX-ptQZbw?t=47m24s

- An overview of some of his arty, hacky work

- plus, he probed all our phones, Walls Have Eyes style

- some stuff about the workshops he runs in Berlin, enabling non-technical folk & activists to understand the networks they're bound up in

### Session: The Technological Body

#### Legacy Russell 
#### Simone Niquille 
#### Sarah Kember ðŸŒŸ

- lots of things promise "the end of work" - for whom?
-- there are still a lot of kitchens and shopping lists in these futures
- full automatism == male solutionism
- "the work of antagonism has never been more important"
